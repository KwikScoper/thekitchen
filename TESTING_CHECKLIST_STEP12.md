## Automated Testing Commands

### Run Automated Test Suite
```bash
# Run the automated test script
node test_step12_automated.js
```

### Run Browser Console Tests
```javascript
// Copy and paste this into browser console
// Load the browser test script
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/browser_test_step12.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);

// Run tests after script loads
setTimeout(() => {
  testRoomPageInBrowser();
}, 1000);
```
